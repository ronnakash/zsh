### TODO: 
1. ft -> ct and fl -> cl
2. make ft and fl for files
3. refactor fzf code to use 1 function
4. search history with fzf and execute: needs to add last action from history (we are currently skipping the last call to prevent showing the current hs call, will break just adding, so consider modifying the hs entry in the history)
5. tmux
6. cheatsheet (probably need a fill cli tool)
